Hi! Welcome to YATB or Yet another tech blog. My name is Chris Schneider, I am currently attending college and learning about NetSec. My journey is going to start post-OSCP as I have only now gotten around to setting up a blog. Follow me along while I learn about the areas OSCP did not cover. My focus is going to be on exploiting and penetration testing but if there is anything else I find that is useful I will share here on my blog!

Thanks for your time and I hope you find something useful on here!
